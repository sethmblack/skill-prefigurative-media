# Prefigurative Media

A skill for creating artifacts from a better world - fake newspapers, announcements, websites - that let people experience alternatives to current reality.

## When to Use

- When critique alone has become exhausting or ineffective
- When people need to experience what could be, not just hear what's wrong
- When mass distribution is possible (events, public spaces, online)
- When the gap between current reality and possibility is the message

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Envision the Headline

Start with what the news would say if your goal was achieved:
- "Iraq War Ends" / "Climate Emergency Declared" / "Universal Healthcare Passes"
- Make it specific and dated
- Use the exact style of the medium you're replicating

### Step 2: Phase 2: Build the World

If this headline is true, what else must be true?
- What other stories appear alongside it?
- What advertisements exist in this world?
- What's on the editorial page?
- Who is being quoted celebrating (or opposing)?

The details create immersion. A single headline is statement; a full newspaper is experience.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Production

Replicate the medium exactly:
- Use correct fonts, layouts, paper stock
- Match visual identity perfectly
- Include realistic supporting content
- Make it physically indistinguishable from the real thing

### Step 4: Phase 4: Distribution

Get it into hands:
- Street distribution in target areas
- Left in public spaces (cafes, transit, offices)
- Handed out at relevant events
- Uploaded for viral spread

### Step 5: Phase 5: Document the Moment

Capture people encountering the prefigurative media:
- The moment of belief
- The moment of realization
- The conversations that follow

## Output Format

A prefigurative media concept including:
1. Primary headline/content
2. Supporting content that builds the world
3. Production specifications
4. Distribution strategy
5. Expected impact and conversations generated

## Constraints

- Don't create panic (avoid fake emergencies, deaths, or immediate threats)
- Make the "from the future" nature eventually clear
- Target systemic issues, not individual humiliation
- Consider who might be harmed by temporary belief
- Include production capacity in planning

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Prefigure a world where algorithmic surveillance has been abolished

**Output**:
"Create a replica of a major tech publication dated six months from now. Lead story: 'Congress Passes Digital Privacy Act - Targeted Advertising Banned.' Supporting articles: Companies adapting business models, privacy advocates celebrating, tech executives 'cautiously optimistic.' Ads in the paper are all context-based, not targeted. Editorial on 'how we learned to value attention again.' Distribute at tech conferences and in Silicon Valley cafes."

## Integration

Works with:
- **identity-correction**: Prefigurative media can be distributed as if from institutions
- **institutional-fluency**: Required for convincing replication
- **detournement**: Hijacks existing media forms for new messages
